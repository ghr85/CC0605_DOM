# Codeclan Week 06 Day 05
## Weekend Homework
### Welcome to the DOM

The task given this week is to create a simple web app to log a a collection of things using JavaScript
to alter the DOM.

In my case I've chosen to create  a simple plant tracker which will log plants and their care habits.
With any luck this will tie into a future app and API which might help me.

#### Order of Approach
Create Web page - structure is key here as you'll be accessing DOM elements.

Give anything that needs accessed/will rigger an ID for ease.

Once this is done create your context of DOMContentLoaded.

Assign variable to elements/values/properties which need to be accessed/modified

Create events to function as triggers.

Refactor where possible


#### Notes

* Big notes: if you give radios/checkboxes the same name they are treated as an array
* Remember the DOM tree. It's hierarchical, you can drill down to the element/property you want.

#### Files
* index.html - Main HTML file for garden Tracker
* app.js - Javascript file containing functions
furious_styles.css - Styles for above
